// . Q + A
// How do we assign a value to a variable?
making a unique name and equal to that value

// How do we change the value of a variable?
variable = value;

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?

// B. Strings
// Create a variable called firstVariable.
// Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
// Change the value of this variable to some number.
// Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable
// Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
var firstVariable;
firstVariable = "Hello World";
console.log(firstVariable);
firstVariable = 9;
console.log(firstVariable);
var secondVariable = firstVariable;
console.log(secondVariable);
secondVariable = secondVariable.toString();
console.log(typeof secondVariable);


// What is the value of firstVariable?
firstVariable = 9;
console.log(firstVariable);

right now it is equal to 9

// Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.

var yourName = "Kenny";
console.log(typeof yourName);

yourName = "Hello, my name is " + "Kenny";
console.log(yourName);
